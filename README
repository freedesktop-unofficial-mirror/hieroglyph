Hieroglyph
=============
Hieroglyph is a PostScript rendering library with having an
own PostScript interpreter engine and support for pluggable
output devices and the extensions.

Why did you start this project now?
======================================
Because I am very interested in making a PostScript Virtual
Machine.  However this is not a trigger of starting this
project actually. I was/am sometimes working on around the
printing stuff, because it was necessary to get them working
on any languages. they had problems on dealing with the
fonts, and they were sometimes easily broken on it. it
finally became my frustration. I could help them out every
time after the breakage, but I stoped to think about.

There are a lot of similar softwares in the FOSS world. but
are not in the PostScript interpreter/rendering library. you
know that there are the forked project, such as ESP
Ghostscript say, I would see that it is one software in the
general meaning.  Right now PostScript specification is very
stable and being perishing. and it may be unlikely to extend
something like other softwares does since that specification
may restricts it. but I believe that making another software
will be helpful to improve/add momentum to the printing
software area.
